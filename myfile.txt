A Library lends books and magazines to member, who is registered in the system. It also
maintains the purchase of new books and magazines for the Library. A member can reserve a
book or magazine that is not currently available in the library, so that when it is returned or
purchased by the library, that person is notified. The library can easily create, replace and delete
information about the books, members, and reservation in the system. The books transactions are
stored in the database. The fine list while the member returns the book after the due date must be
generated. Analyze the users and actors of this system, and the interactions between them must be
depicted.
